CRASH-TEST DUMMIES

MAY LOOK HUMAN, BUT THEY'RE

ACTUALLY HIGH-TECH GUINEA PIGS

FOR A WIDE RANGE OF IMPACT

TESTS.

SO, HOW DO THEY MAKE DUMMIES

WHOSE FORM AND STRUCTURE MIMIC

THE HUMAN BODY?

YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

CRASH-TEST DUMMIES ARE

DESIGNED TO TAKE SOME SERIOUS

HITS.

AUTOMAKERS USE THE DATA THEY

PROVIDE TO BUILD SAFER CARS,

VANS, AND TRUCKS.

A DUMMY'S ANATOMY IS PRETTY

SIMPLE.

BENEATH ITS VINYL SKIN, THERE'S

A METAL SKELETON MADE OF STEEL

AND ALUMINUM BONES.

THOSE BONES CONTAIN LOAD CELLS,

ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT MEASURE

CRASH FORCE.

PRODUCTION OF THE LOAD CELLS

BEGINS WITH A MACHINE THAT

SHAPES STEEL BARS USING A SOLID

CARBIDE END MILL.

LUBRICANT COOLS THE INTENSE HEAT

AND WASHES AWAY THE METAL

PARTICLES.

USING A PRECISION TOOL CALLED

THE DIAL INDICATOR, WORKERS

VERIFY THE LOAD CELL'S

DIMENSIONS TO WITHIN 2/1,000

OF AN INCH.

NEXT COMES THE STRAIN GAUGE --

THE COMPONENT WITHIN THE

LOAD CELL THAT MEASURED CRASH

FORCE.

THE HAIR-WIDTH WIRES THAT

CONNECT THE STRAIN GAUGES ARE SO

DELICATE THAT SOLDERING THEM

REQUIRES A MICROSCOPE.

THE VERTEBRA IN THE DUMMY'S NECK

ALSO CONTAINS A LOAD CELL.

THE STRAIN GAGE SOLDERED INSIDE

IT MEASURES NOT JUST LATERAL AND

VERTICAL FORCES, BUT ALSO TWIST,

OR TORSIONAL FORCE.

THE COMPLETED BONES AND

CORRESPONDING LOAD CELLS ARE

LAID OUT, BUT THEY CAN'T BE

CONNECTED UNTIL THE DUMMY'S RIB

CAGE IS COMPLETE.

TO MAKE THE RIB CAGE, STEEL

BANDS ARE BONDED TO A FLEXIBLE

DAMPING MATERIAL.

THIS MATERIAL WAS ORIGINALLY

DESIGNED TO DEADEN SOUND IN

NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.

IT ALLOWS THE DUMMY'S RIB CAGE

TO COMPRESS JUST LIKE THE REAL

THING.

A TECHNICIAN BOLTS THE

ENTIRE RIB ASSEMBLY TO THE

SPINAL COLUMN AND COVERS IT WITH

A PLASTIC CHEST PLATE CALLED A

BIB.

THE LONG BONES AND LOAD-CELL

FORMS ARE INSERTED INTO ALUMINUM

MOLDS.

WORKERS THEN BOLT THE MOLDS SHUT

AND POUR IN LIQUID VINYL.

THE MOLDS BAKE AT AROUND 350

DEGREES FAHRENHEIT FOR 10 TO 20

MINUTES.

WHEN THEY COME OUT, WORKERS CUT

AWAY ANY FLASH -- THE EXCESS

VINYL THAT OOZES OUT DURING THE

BAKING PROCESS.

THEN, A TECHNICIAN INSPECTS THE

COMPONENTS TO ENSURE AN ACCURATE

FIT.

THIS IS NO ORDINARY VINYL.

IT'S SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO

RESEMBLE HUMAN FLESH IN

CONSISTENCY AND DENSITY.

THIS GIVES RESEARCHERS REALISTIC

CRASH DATA.

NOW, IT'S TIME TO INSTALL THE

BONES INTO THEIR RESPECTIVE

VINYL COMPARTMENTS, STARTING

WITH THIS TIBIA OR SHIN BONE.

ZIPPERS ALLOW THE ENGINEERS TO

EASILY REMOVE THE COMPONENTS

AFTER PERFORMING A CRASH TEST.

A TECHNICIAN BOLTS ALL THE

DUMMY'S JOINTS IN PLACE AND

ENSURES THEY HAVE A HUMAN-LIKE

RANGE OF MOTION.

USING A NECK-COMPRESSION TOOL,

A TECHNICIAN LINES UP A LOAD

SENSOR WITH THE NECK

VERTEBRAE AND FASHIONS THE

COMPLETED NECK ASSEMBLY TO THE

DUMMY'S HEAD.

NEXT, THE UPPER BODY IS

COMPLETED.

THE THORAX IS BOLTED ONTO THE

PELVIS, THE HEAD AND NECK

ASSEMBLY ONTO THE THORAX.

THEN, THE VINYL JACKET IS

FITTED OVER THE CHEST.

FINALLY, THE TECHNICIAN BOLTS

ON THE LIMBS.

CRASH-TEST DUMMIES RANGE IN

SIZE FROM NEWBORNS ALL THE WAY

UP TO 225-POUND ADULTS

SO THAT AUTO MANUFACTURERS

CAN BE SURE THEIR SEAT BELTS

AND AIR BAGS PROTECT EVERYONE

EQUALLY WELL.

IT TOOK A FULL 12 WEEKS TO

MAKE THIS DUMMY, AND NOW HE'S

READY FOR A LIFE OF HARD KNOCKS

TO MAKE TRAVELING SAFER FOR ALL

OF US.
