# HowItsGenerated

This is Nathaniel Gordon's final project for CS4120, Natural Language Processing.

## Artist's Statement

*Media that we look back on as defining experience often embodies a specific tone or feeling that ushers in feelings of comfort and familiarity. For me, the episodes of the popular television program How It's Made evoke strong memories of my childhood, and how the series helped inspire me to pursue a career in technology.*

*Through the use of language modeling techniques, my work seeks to capture this nostalgia and replicate it with completely novel generated  content. Specifically, the script for this video was produced with the transformer language model GPT-2, and was trained on nearly 500 episodes of How It's Made. The accompanying footage was sourced from real episodes of the program, with the clips cut in such a way to mimic the meaning of the script.*

*The experience of nostalgia is highly individual. Without the context of past experiences, many viewers may feel nothing but mild confusion when watching the video. Others may associate aspects of the media with any number of past experiences, both positive and negative. Regardless of what you feel, challenge yourself to consider what sorts of experiences would evoke positive nostalgic feelings in yourself, and how the ability to replicate the stimuli of those memories could be cathartic.*
